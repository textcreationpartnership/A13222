            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vdicious and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reader. Out of our high reſpect vnto that <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> of our times, that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly victorious King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> wee haue here (and for thy pleaſure too) adventured vpon an Eſſay of his Story; which if liked, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs to continue it. Not out of any confidence, that ours is a Chronicle worthy enough, for ſuch heroick performances (a <hi>Polibius,</hi> or a <hi>Tacitus</hi> were little enough for that) but our intention chiefly is, to provoke ſome abler Pen, ſome better inſtructed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer, to doe it: and if ſuch a one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
<pb facs="tcp:18626:3"/>
or mend vs, wee will not be angry. If you here demaund, out of what Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wee haue furniſht our <hi>Intelligencer;</hi> be pleaſed to know; that nothing is willingly feigned, or wilfully falſified. The errors that be in it, are errors of ignorance, all. Some part of it was received from the papers of an honourable perſonage; a Commaunder of prime credit and activitie, with that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King. Wee haue beene made to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand much of theſe Actions, by diſcourſe with another gallant Gentleman: and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great Commaunder in the Army. Some printed <hi>High Dutch</hi> bookes wee haue had. For ſome things we haue had private wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and from good hands too. In other things we haue made vſe of <hi>Gallobelgicus:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where he deales vpon publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and where we thought the poore man durſt ſpeake freely: Some times, ſure, he writes but by Commiſſion; and is every where ſparing in reporting the Emperours loſſes. And yet in this, to take away all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, we haue followed him too; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding wee by others found greater numbers and defeates, ſpecified. Very good
<pb facs="tcp:18626:3"/>
vſe haue wee made of the <hi>Weekely Currantoes</hi> too: which if a man of judgement reades, he ſhall for the moſt part finde (eſpecially of latter times) very true, and very punctuall. Whoſoever will be cunning in the <hi>Topogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and would vnderſtand theſe warres, let him not deſpiſe <hi>Currantoes.</hi> All this, laſtly hath paſſed the allowance of a Gentleman (of the beſt judgement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence for theſe matters) in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Wee haue every where dealt candidely, not magnifying the King, nor derogating from his enemies: not left out, or put in, for favour or advantage. Our methode is this: to handle every Story by it ſelfe, and then to bring all together at the day of Battell. Carefull haue we beene, (yea no ſmall paines haue we taken;) to note the times and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the places of the moſt famous actions. We haue examined the dates with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; and ſtill had fiue Maps before vs of the ſame place. The <hi>Imperiall Dyet</hi> of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was well hoped would haue mended all, leaving things farre more deſperate on the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> partie; neceſſitated a Reſolution in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:18626:4"/>
of that Confeſſion; rather to dye free, then to liue ſlaues. Hence their <hi>Dyet</hi> of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſich.</hi> And becauſe theſe Leaguers were at firſt of an Vnion by themſelues; we haue briefly therefore, and vpon the Bye, firſt handled their warlike preparations; vntill the day of their joyning with the King. The ſame haue we done with the Kings Story: gone along with it from his Majeſties firſt landing. The Kings having of many Armies in the field at once, troubled vs not a little at the firſt, to finde with which of all theſe Armyes the King in perſon ſhould be: but wee after a while perceived, that this moſt induſtrious Chieftaine, was able to ſerve more Cures at once then one: and that he was ſo vigilant vpon every occaſion, that there were few great Actions which himſelfe was not at one end of. Many a brave Generall he hath; The Lord <hi>Oxenſterne,</hi> a <hi>Sweden</hi> borne, and Lord Chancellor of that Kingdome; Generall all this while of a particular Army in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> to waite vpon the <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> and his motions: The Lord <hi>Falkenburg,</hi> a <hi>Germane</hi> borne, and Lord Chamberlayn of his Majeſties houſhold; vnfortunately ſlaine in <hi>Magdenburg.</hi> The Lord
<pb facs="tcp:18626:4"/>
               <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> a <hi>Finlander:</hi> and ſtill Generall of a particular Army by himſelfe: with whom the Lord Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> is aſſociated, The Lord <hi>Otho Todt,</hi> for brevities ſake call'd <hi>Otty-todt,</hi> or <hi>Todt,</hi> a <hi>Swede,</hi> Generall of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Horſe; Sir <hi>Iohn Bannier,</hi> a <hi>Germane,</hi> and a braue Souldier, Generall of the Foote or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery: all theſe you finde frequent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable mention of; and yet hath the King himſelfe beene at the moſt of the buſineſſe. All particular actions it had beene impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to haue toucht vpon; therefore haue we endevored to relate the famouſeſt: whether Sieges, Battels, Marches, Encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, or Removings: orderly leading all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto the great day of battell. It would haue perplexed our methode to haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned every particular ſupply that the King hath had: thoſe therefore wee deſire the Readers to imagine. For example: he landed but 11. Regiments or thouſands of Foote at firſt: yet within a moneth was his Army full 20000. ſtrong: which daily increaſed alſo.</p>
            <p>His numbers, indeede, were never great: he had but 5000. men, for the moſt part, and
<pb facs="tcp:18626:5"/>
never aboue 7000. in all his late warres of <hi>Pruſsia</hi> againſt the <hi>Pole:</hi> and yet with them hath he fought ſeverall Battels, beaten out, or wearied out, two <hi>Imperiall</hi> Armies; taken in the great and ſtrong Citie of <hi>Elbing,</hi> with others: and obtained his purpoſe finally, vpon his enemy; who was able at once to haue come downe with ſuch a power of Horſe vpon him, as had beene ſufficient to haue carryed away himſelfe and fiue ſuch Armies. That which hath made his Majeſtie ſo victorious, (next to the aſſiſtance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God,) is his moſt exact obſerving of military Diſcipline; wherein with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable temper, he is both ſtrict and ſweete: the Majeſtie of a King in him, commanding more willing obedience from his Army, then the awfull directions of a bare Generall alone, poſſibly could. Adde to his ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, his many poynts of new invented Diſcipline, peculiar vnto himſelfe, too long here to deſcribe. His juſtice, finally, and his mercy; his exemplary and his indefatigable induſtry: his affabilitie, and his eaſineſſe of acceſſe: the goodneſſe of his cauſe, and the common Libertie which his victories bring
<pb facs="tcp:18626:5"/>
with them: haue conquered more then his ſword. What now ſhall hinder this braue and princely Warriour, to arriue vnto that height of reputation which <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> did in the warres of <hi>Naples;</hi> whom the Hiſtorians of that age, worthily ſtile, <hi>the great Captaine?</hi> yea ſo great a Conquerour hath the King hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beene, that I dare challenge the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Hiſtorian, to ſet (for all particulars) ſuch another by him. God bleſſe the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Majeſtie: and thoroughly enable him, to be the glorious <hi>Aſſertor</hi> of the <hi>Germane</hi> Libertie. <hi>Vale.</hi>

               <hi>If the Readers deſire the continuance of our Relations: our</hi> Intelligencer <hi>ſhall be much the better furniſhed to giue Content, if they pleaſe to ſend vs in their owne Intelligence.</hi>

               <hi>For that it ſeemes impoſsible for vs</hi> Engliſh <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde that obſervation of</hi> Philip de Commines, That in all great actions, wee are ſtill hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after Prophecies; <hi>which the taking of ſome things in this kinde, hath even now verified: wee will therefore feede the humor of the times a little, with a</hi> Prediction <hi>of a great Aſtronomer of our owne Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon that great</hi> Conjunction <hi>of</hi> Saturne <hi>and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18626:6"/>
Iupiter, <hi>Iuly</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1623. <hi>And the ſecond a</hi> Prophecy <hi>of the famous</hi> Paulus Grebnerus <hi>his Booke, now in</hi> Trinitie Colledge <hi>in</hi> Cambridge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Aſtronomers judgement is this. That the effect of that</hi> Conjunction <hi>would be felt in the North and Northeaſt parts of</hi> Europe <hi>in particular: and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall over all. That it would produce Famines, Plagues, Warres, &amp;c. Places ſubiect to this, he nameth</hi> Italy, France, Bohemia, Sileſia, <hi>and</hi> Germany. <hi>Of Provinces he nameth</hi> Pruſſia, Brandenburg, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Haſſia, <hi>and</hi> Saxony. <hi>Yea he deſcends to Cities: naming</hi> Rome, Prague, Magdenburg, Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents <hi>betwixt</hi> Mentz <hi>and</hi> Cullen, Vlmes, Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Ausburg, &amp;c. <hi>He ſayes it is likely to goe hard with the</hi> Romane <hi>Empire, Clergie, and</hi> Ieſuites. <hi>He ſpeakes of a King of a true Religion that ſhould doe all this: and of much happineſſe that ſhould ſucceede it. The whole Diſcourſe will perchance ſhortly be imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>

               <p>But theſe <hi>Court-Harpyes</hi> forſooth, now after that vnder the pretence of treaſons againſt the Emperour, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of forbidden Religions; they had with their vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talons, foully gryped <hi>Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> and both the <hi>Auſtria's,</hi> and wrung the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> (whoſe caſe was rather to be pittied) out of their inheritances: their inſatiable mawes being not yet full cramb'd, they now whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Clawes and infamous beakes againe, to devoure the wealth of the <hi>Empire.</hi> That their yawning gullets, were yet ſet wider vpon the tenterhookes, by the eaſineſſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; in whoſe ſervice (he being a Prince too much go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Officers) men might offend with leſſe feare, and greater reward.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Imperiall <hi>Dyet</hi> thus ending <hi>November</hi> 3/23. left matters in farre worſe eſtate than it found them: for that men perceived now their very hopes to be taken away, as their liberties and goods had beene before. And the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues ſtartled by foure things eſpecially, perceived it high time now for them to take the Alarme. The firſt of the foure was this: that whereas the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> had in the time of the <hi>Dyet</hi> written advice vnto the Emperour, of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> approaching; the Emperour tells him againe, how he hoped that himſelfe <hi>(Saxony)</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> would well ayde him, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, munition, and other neceſſaries. By which anſwere, <hi>Saxony</hi> perceived a new bill of Charges comming vpon the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> next thoſe parts, where the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was landed. The ſecond was this: the round courſe taken by the Emperour for the recovering of the Church Lands: which neither the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> was able to ſtay by his Letters vnto the Emperour; nor the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, with their preſence at the <hi>Dyet:</hi> but that even before their owne faces, daily Commiſſions were ſent out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. A third was this: that rigide courſe (taken by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18626:19"/>
adviſe of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi>) for Reformation of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> and <hi>Schooles,</hi> and the forbidding of the libertie of the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſſion.</hi> The fourth was, that <hi>Decree</hi> of the Emperours (publiſhed foure dayes before the breaking vp of the <hi>Dyet,</hi> though hammered vpon long before:) for the continuance of the Warres againſt the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> whereas the way had beene propounded and adviſed vpon before, how to compound the matter, rather then how to continue the troubles. And that which aggravated the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the warres being; not onely that the Princes were to be at the charges of it, but that the levies were to be layd and collected, not by the conſent of thoſe who ſhould pay them, but at the pleaſure of the Imperiall <hi>Commiſſaries:</hi> for the moderating of whoſe power, and repreſſing the numbers and inſolencies of the Souldiers, notwithſtanding ſome ſlight promiſes were now made; yet how far they would be kept, was in their owne pleaſures. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being not onely made ſuſpitious, but ſenſible too; that there were not too many good intentions in the Emperour towards them, their Eſtates or Religions: begin to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conſultation for their owne ſafetie. The plot for it was layd thus. That whereas there had beene a Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Catholikes</hi> at the former <hi>Dyet,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church Lands; the further treatie thereupon, was referred vnto a <hi>Dyet</hi> (procured by the <hi>Catholikes</hi>) to be held at <hi>Franckford</hi> vpon <hi>Mayn,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſhould write his Letters vnto the <hi>Emperor,</hi> (which was ſeconded by the mediation of the <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. That when the time and place for this Treatie were once appointed; the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould there appeare a little

               <p n="6">6.

And that he carried a more private good affection vnto the King, then he thought it convenient as yet to diſcover; appeares by his deſiring of ſome expert Commanders of the King, (and Colonell <hi>Teuffell</hi> by name) to leade his Army: But this did not the King at this preſent yeeld vnto; becauſe that had rather engaged the King vnto him, then him vnto the King.

By this time was the ſayd Kings Army drawne downe as farre as <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> himſelfe is now at the Conſultation of <hi>Torgau: Brandenburg</hi> was already joyned with him: and nothing hindred <hi>Saxonyes</hi> vniting too; but ſome termes partly of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

and partly of honour; whether he were to yeeld the whole Command of his owne Army vnto the King, or not? Which the King abſolutely deſiring, and the Duke making ſome Objections againſt, the Vnion was the longer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding.</p>
               <p>Well! if <hi>Saxony</hi> will not joyne, <hi>Tillyes</hi> haſt (for he longs to be beaten) ſhall quicken his ſlowneſſe.

His expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the warres being great, his fame (now after the beating of the <hi>Pole,</hi> and two Imperiall Armies in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi>) more; he was alſo thought to be the ableſt to deliver them. His Majeſtie therefore being by the pittifull and redoubled complaints of his Allyes, his Confederates, his Neighbours, ſollicited over and over againe to come in vnto their reſcue; that this bare invitation of his Friends might not be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a plot betwixt them, or not to be cauſe enough for his comming: loe, he is even puld over by his enemies provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.

That conſidering how things ſtood betwixt the Emperour and himſelfe, it much concerned him not to ſuffer that Iſland and Towne, to be poſſeſſed by his enemies: ſeeing they lye ſo commodiouſly for the commaund of the <hi>Balticke</hi> Sea; and ſo dangerouſly for infeſting of the Coaſts of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which be right againſt it. That the Emperour had actually moleſted thoſe Coaſts with ſhipping; which he had newly gotten from <hi>Dantzick</hi> and other <hi>Hanſe</hi> Townes thereabouts: had hindered the <hi>Swediſh</hi> trade, and merchandizing vpon the Coaſts of <hi>Germany:</hi> taken his Shippes by repriſall at Sea; layd <hi>imbargoes</hi> vpon them to arreſt them in the Ports and Havens: and had purpoſed to make the <hi>Sound</hi> and Sea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, to be the ſeate of their pyracies; to the vtter vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> trade that way, and the great moleſtation of all Nations that trafficke in thoſe Seas.

That his owne comming with an Army into the bounds of the Empire, was vnder publicke proteſtation of no hoſtilitie meant vnto the Empire, or perſon of the Emperour. That his comming was principally to relieue that diſtreſſed Prince his Coſin and Confederate, the Duke of <hi>Stetin</hi> and <hi>Pomeren,</hi> miſerably at that time, and ſo for three yeares had beene, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly oppreſſed by the Emperour.

That his League with the ſayd Duke, was <hi>Defenſiue</hi> onely: and not for any <hi>offenſiue</hi> warre againſt the Emperour. That in recovering of the Ile of <hi>Rugen,</hi> he had rather fayrely turn'd out, then beaten out, the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> That the end of his comming, was no more then the reliefe of <hi>Straleſundt</hi> and <hi>Pomerlandt;</hi> and the ſecuring of his owne Dominions of <hi>Sweden:</hi> too neere vnto which he perceived the Emperour to be now encroaching, with no good intention.

               <p>Theſe Complaints, Aggrievances, and Provocations of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> were in fayre and reſpectfull manner, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters firſt preſented vnto the Emperour: and when that courſe brought no redreſſe, then for juſtification of his proceedings, and by way of Apologie, were the Circumſtances enlarged, and the whole Printed, for the world to judge vpon: and that all indifferent Readers might there receiue an Accompt of the Cauſes, which at length conſtrained him to mooue with an Army into <hi>Germany.</hi>

The Duke perceiving his Majeſtie, though pleaſant, yet earneſt; deſires leave to goe againe into the Towne. The King conſents vnto the motion: but ſent order withall vnto the Lord <hi>Reay,</hi> to guard the Dukes perſon thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward: and that when the draw-bridge was let downe, and the Ports ſet open for the Dukes Coach; to enter the Towne together with it; and if it were poſſible, to make good the Port. The Lord <hi>Rcay</hi> having enough of his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo diſpoſes his Muskettiers (which were <hi>Scottiſh</hi>) that two hundred of them marcht before the Coach; and muſt needs therefore enter before the Dukes Coach could: ſo that this peice of ſervice was done, even as the King would haue it. Thus the Lord <hi>Reay</hi> being entred within the outter Port, the Towne Garriſon retyred from thence within the inner Port: and the <hi>Scots</hi> entring pell-mell with them, that Port

was alſo taken. By this did the King preſently enter the Towne, with his whole Army. The Duke ſeeing this, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes his owne forces, which he had till then, there kept in Garriſon: who thereupon tooke preſent oath and pay, for the Kings ſervice.</p>
               <p>The next morning, the King commaunds Sir <hi>Iohn Bannier</hi> Generall of his Infantery, to take with him 600. <hi>Swediſh</hi> Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers, vnder the commaund of Grave <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and 600. <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Muskettiers, vnder the commaund of the Lord <hi>Reay;</hi> to make an aſſault vpon the Towne of <hi>Damme,</hi> lying a mile to the South-Eaſt of <hi>Stetin.</hi> The Towne had on that ſide but one approach vnto it; and that was a narrow cauſey leading thorough the mariſh, vpon which the Towne ſtood. Thoſe 12000. men now advanc't almoſt as farre as a Sconce, which guarded the end of the Towne; a Country-boore comming vp to the Commanders, proffers them his ſervice to leade them a ſecret way thorough the mariſh: by which meanes, they might more eaſily fall on, vpon the other ſide of the Towne. But the Burgers of the Towne, (who it ſeemes had intelligence with the Kings forces) now ſending vnto them; deſired them to haue the patience but to ſtay vntill night, and then they promiſed to giue them entrance by a private poſterne gate. This delay was cunningly projected by the Towneſmen; and ſerved them to very good purpoſe: for had the Kings forces taken the Towne by aſſault, then, by the Law of Armes, had the pillage of the whole Towne beene their owne. Thus, (vpon what reaſons or feares I know not) the enemies Garriſon conſiſting of ſome two hundred and fiftie Muskettiers, and fortie horſe, forſooke the Towne that very evening; taking their way Eaſt-ward, towards the next Towne of <hi>Stargard.</hi> With the Burgers of this Towne of <hi>Stargard,</hi> the King having alſo intelligence; inſtantly ſends thither alſo. But whether it was, that he thought not fit too farre to giue truſt vnto thoſe Burgers, and to adventure his owne men vpon their honeſties; eſpecially ſince the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was thus lately reenforced: ſure it is, that he employed none of his owne men, but committed the charge vnto that

Colonell and his men, who had layn in Garriſon in <hi>Stetin,</hi> before his <hi>Majeſties</hi> comming thither. This Colonel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country perfectly, came by night vpon the Towne: and having given advertiſement vnto theſe Burgers within, with whom he had correſpondency; they ſecretly opening a Port vnto him, giue him preſent entrance. He thus got in, preſently cuts in peices the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> which had the Watch vpon the Market-place. This done, he without ſtay goes towards another Port, which had two ſtrong Sconces before it; theſe he preſently aſſaulted, killing three hundred and fiftie Souldiers which he found within them. This act, had like to haue loſt him the towne: for the reſt of the towne Garriſon, (which were aſleepe in their beds when he at firſt entred,) now hearing the noyſe, ſtart vp, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto their Armes; ſhutting withall, the Port behinde the Kings Colonell, who was now buſily employed, vpon the execution within the Sconces. Very hard had it beene for him to haue entred the Towne againe, but that the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at the ſame time taking Armes; by force opened ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Port for him. The Garriſon by this time having gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a head vpon the Market-place, now finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too weake to reſiſt ſo great forces; retire themſelues into the Church-ſteeple: but now the <hi>Swediſh</hi> turning the Canon which they had gotten in the two Sconces, againſt the ſteeple; the Garriſon forthwith yeeld themſelues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioning to goe off with their liues and Armes ſaved.</p>
               <p>There were found in this Towne of <hi>Stargard,</hi> 500. barrels of meale; much powder and ſhott, and ſome Ordnance. The King after fortifies the place, with fiue new Bulwarkes, three halfe Moones, and ſuch other Outworkes. Whileſt this was a doing,<note place="margin">The Ile of <hi>Cammin</hi> taken.</note>

were but the King made their Protector. The overture of a League firſt, and the Articles afterward, were therefore now treated vpon, concluded, and publiſhed, about the tenth of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> This League conquered him the whole Countrey. The King, in a Preface prefixed to the Articles,<note place="margin">A League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and <hi>Begiſlaus</hi> Duke of <hi>Stetin</hi> and <hi>Pomeren.</hi>
                  </note> excuſes the Duke; profeſſing to haue taken the Towne againſt his will. The Duke alſo ſubjoynes his owne Apologie; That he had beene forced to this League. 1. For that having no ayd from others. 2. He was too weake to haue reſiſted the King. 3. And that his Subjects having beene diſarmed by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Defenders the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> 4. Yea ſo impoveriſhed, that they had not meanes ſufficient left, barely to liue vpon; were thereby diſabled to defend themſelues. 5. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for three yeares together endured the hardeſt of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; they were deſirous rather to be freed, then further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, in a new warre and dangers. 6. Eſpecially having beene ſo much diſcouraged to ſerue the Emperour, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept promiſe with them. 7. As for the Kings procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, his courſes taken to eaſe them, were juſt and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. 8. And ſeeing that very chary he was, to oppoſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. 9. As purpoſing onely to reſtraine the inſolency of theſe new oppreſſors. 10. Therefore he thought this League to be his beſt courſe, both to recover his owne eſtate, and to ſecure <hi>Swedens.</hi> Seing therefore the King had paſt his royall word, to be a friend and not a foe, vnto all places which he ſhould recover: he profeſſes himſelfe willinger to entruſt his Countrey in the Kings hands, then hazard the loſſe of all. Foureteene Articles the King and Duke then agree vpon: of all which, theſe two chiefly concerne our Story. 1. That this warre was onely for Defence of the wronged, and not to injure the Emperour. 2. That all places recovered by the King, ſhould be reſtored vnto the Duke. An Excuſe beſides theſe ten former Reaſons, is by the Duke ſent vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: which with the reſt of the Articles we leaue to be read in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Printed Booke of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stetin</hi> being thus agreed with the King, willingly giues him 50000. Rixe Dollars, and the Countrey as many: The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18626:56"/>
not beate him, it were enough to turne him backe againe. And theſe reaſons prevailed: ſo that the Army being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marcht, ſate there downe to refreſh themſelues. Whileſt here they were, eyther the ſame Boore, or ſome other, goes and tells the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> were hard by them: ſo that by three a clocke in the morning they might perceiue the enemies Dorps, all on a flame: for they riſing to be gone homewards, had now ſet fire vpon their Quarters. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> perceiving this, fall generally to blame <hi>Kniphowſen;</hi> reſolving inſtantly to purſue them. Comming to the forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Dorps, there knocke they downe ſome ſixtie men, that the enemy had left behinde, and ſo follow on the reſt. At breake of day, they had ſight of the retyring enemy, vpon a fayre Heath: whereupon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe making more ſpeede, by eight a clocke were vpon the neckes of them. The enemy making <hi>Alt,</hi> turnes faces about to them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe forbeare to charge, till their owne Foote ſhould be come vp to them: who now doubling their march, were hard at hand with them. Thus when the enemy makes a ſtand, ſo doe the <hi>Swediſh</hi> too; and when the enemy marches, the other lyes beating vpon their Reere. The <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> (or <hi>Imperiall</hi> horſe) perceiving themſelues likely to be overmatcht with numbers, play the <hi>Pultrons,</hi> and run away. The Foote goe on in this faſhion, till they came to a Dorpe, or Village, called <hi>Faldinbruch,</hi> there was a paſſage at a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mill; over whoſe bridge they were to goe: and there one of the carriages of their Ordnance breaking, fowlly ſtopt vp their paſſage. Here being crowded and diſordered, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt began alſo to flee. And now fell there ſo ſudden and ſo ſtrange a miſt, that a man could hardly diſcerne two Pikes length before him. The enemies Foote that could not get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bridge, betooke themſelues into the mariſh by the Rivers ſide: ſtanding there vpon their owne defence, with matches Cockt, and Muskets vpon their Reſts. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> comming vp to them, they demaund Quarter: proffering to ſerue the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> vpon condition every Officer to be vnder the King, the ſame they were vnder the Emperour:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18626:56"/>
otherwiſe, they would dye like braue men, and ſell their liues as deare as they could. Quarter and Conditions are both granted them: ſo that there ſtill a while they ſtood. But to ſee the lucke of it; juſt in the meane time, returnes <hi>Baudit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen:</hi> who having beene purſuing the enemies horſe that fled, and now ſo vtterly rowted them, that ſcarce ten of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in a Company: and loſt them in the miſt withall: he ſeeing the enemy ſtand whole in a body together, and not knowing of the agreement; falls to charge them with his horſe. They perceiving this, began to ſuſpect trechery in it; that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe ſhould fall vpon their <hi>Reere,</hi> and the Foot vpon their <hi>Van;</hi> &amp; ſo they ſhould periſh betwixt both. To prevent which, they putting themſelues into two diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, turne backe to backe; thoſe next to <hi>Bauditzen,</hi> all at once giving fayre fire vpon him. That volley made a Fell of many a braue man. <hi>Bauditzen</hi> charges againe, charges home, and thorough them: vtterly breakes and defeats them. The other <hi>Swediſh</hi> body of horſe hearing the fight, and the miſt not ſuffering them to diſcerne the matter, imagined verily, that the enemy had beene come backe againe: yea meſſenger comes vpon meſſenger with the newes,<note place="margin">A ſtrange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take among the <hi>Swediſh.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Our men are vtterly defeated.</hi> And when as ſome of the horſe that had the <hi>Van</hi> of the <hi>Swedens</hi> Foote, came towards them; they certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved them to be enemies, and their owne men to be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and thereupon giue fire vpon them. The other, thinke the Devill to be in it; and that their Foote had beene defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and theſe to be enemies: and therefore fly backe againe to their fellowes. Others alſo comming vpon our <hi>Van,</hi> they fall to charge them: the other as faſt letting fly at them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus having no Colours with vs, wee knew not friends from foes, our enemies, from our fellowes. In this miſerable error, and myſticall meddly wee continue, vntill 4. a clocke at night: when by finding ſome of our owne to be ſlaine, (whom we well knew) we began to find our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. The Emperours whole forces, both foote and horſe, were defeated: their Canon, all their baggage and foure Cornets, taken from them. All our owne horſe, except <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditzens</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:18626:57"/>
owne Regiment, ran away: as alſo the body of our Foote did, which were led by the yong Grave of <hi>Thurne,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Wallenſtein:</hi> onely the <hi>Van</hi> of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Foote ſtood firme; Commanded by Baron <hi>Teuffell,</hi> the Lord <hi>Reay,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Haibron.</hi> So that both the Armies had run away in the miſt; except <hi>Bauditzen</hi> and his Regiment of horſe, and the <hi>Van</hi> of Foote aforeſaid. Theſe ſtayed after the fight, to bury their ſlaine fellowes. This prettie kinde of battell hapned vpon the 11.th of <hi>November,</hi> 1630. In which, what with thoſe that were ſlaine by the enemy, and what they had killed themſelues; were 500. men loſt. The reſt, partly laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their owne miſtake, partly ſorry for their fellowes and <hi>Comrades;</hi> and partly glad to haue defeated the enemy; they returne homewards againe: <hi>Bauditzen</hi> and <hi>Kniphowſen</hi> vnto their ſiege; and the other vnto their Leaguer.</p>
               <p>Preſently after this, in the middle of the ſame <hi>November,</hi> were there 182. houſes burnt within the Citie: the fault was layd vpon the negligence of a ſervant: though others ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be a villany of the beſieged: Sure it is, that there were Letters intercepted by the <hi>Swediſh,</hi> which ſhould haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Garriſon, that ſeeing they could not be relieved, the beſt way were to fire the Towne, and by a reſolute ſally to breake through the enemy. This is like vnto the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> practiſes in other places: who at <hi>Gartz</hi> and <hi>Grippenhagen</hi> about the ſame time, made ſtay of all the Boats that came vp the <hi>Oder,</hi> having a deſigne to fire <hi>Stargard</hi> with them; by that meanes to haue delivered <hi>Colbergen.</hi> The ſame they threatned vnto <hi>Stetin</hi> alſo: which made thoſe Townes ſtand vpon their guard the ſurer. Towards the end of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> cut off the freſh water that ſerv'd the Citie. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>December,</hi> the beſieged vpon an advantage ſallying out, ſurprize a Lieutenant, with ſome thirtie of their enemies; and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> within a while after, cut off a Convoy of 180 Wagons laden with Corne and other proviſions, which was going into the Citie: an hundred of which they bring away; the reſt which they had not time nor meanes to doe, they ſet fire on. In <hi>February</hi> when the King was gone towards <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburg,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:18626:57"/>
the Garriſon making abroad, fetch in 500. head of Cattell one with another. Thus paſt there encounters too and againe betwixt them, till the end of <hi>February.</hi> the 26. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they now finding their proviſions to fayle within, &amp; their hopes without; ſend to parlie with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Generall, who acquaints the King with it.

               <p>A report was alſo ſpread abroad in the Country, that before their giving vp of the Towne, they had digd mines, and layd gun-powder and burning matches by it; which after two or three dayes ſhould take fire, and blow vp the Towne; which the <hi>Swedes</hi> in good time diſcovering, ſent after them in all haſt, to call them backe to an account for their baſe trechery.

aboue a league or two, vpon his right hand. If ſome make doubt, why being ſo neere he ſet not vpon the King; the queſtion is eaſily anſwered; for that the Kings Camp was ſo ſtrong, that he durſt not.

Of any aſſaults or attempts vpon the Towne, I reade not: nor of any ſallyes made by the beſieged; but that fatall one, made by <hi>Peruſie,</hi> then Governor there: in which skirmiſh, himſelfe and his Ritmaiſter were both ſlaine. The occaſion of it was thus: <hi>Iune</hi> 10th very early in the morning a partie of <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe adventure to driue away ſome Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, feeding cloſe by one of the Ports: which one of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels deſcrying, diſcharges his Musket, the Towne taking the Alarme vpon it. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſuſpecting ſome ſuch matter, dreſſe a fine Ambuſcado for them. Out ſallyes 4. companies; and amongſt them <hi>Peruſie,</hi> his Sergeant major or Ritmaiſter, and a Knight of the <hi>Dutch</hi> order. Theſe ſallyers being in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate caſe within, become the more adventurous without. Well! the Governors courage carrying him too farre in the purſuit of thoſe, that did but feigne to flie; the ambuſh ſtarts vp, and cuts betweene the Towne and him. The <hi>Crabats</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the danger, avoyde it by forſaking of their Maiſter. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Knight is ſlaine firſt; and the Governor not long after. By this time are there more forces of the King come in; which had marcht hard all night for that purpoſe; the plot being layd, that the game ſhould thus be begun, before they were diſcovered. Now doe the <hi>Swedens</hi> make their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18626:74"/>
to the walls: and after an houres ſpace, the Towne is moſt ſtreightly beſieged. Firſt the beſiegers ſhew the Towne that they haue Canon, and then ſend to ſummon them by a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: Their anſwer was, that they would fight it out. Now are the Ordnance ſet to worke (which ſome call playing:) a faire ſaultable breach is made. The Garriſon is as good as their words, for by that breach which the <hi>Swedens</hi> thought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the other ſally: yea ſo hard they lay vpon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> foot, that had not the horſe ſtruck in, they had made foule worke: but being by this meanes beaten into the Towne, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſound a parlie. The aſſault is given over; Conditions of yeelding agreed vpon; which came to thus much:<note place="margin">Taken.</note> That vpon <hi>Iune</hi> 16. they ſhould depart with flying enſignes, bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and be convoyed vnto <hi>Loitz</hi> firſt, and to march into <hi>Roſtock</hi> afterwards. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> convoy being ſomething too weake for them, they would not keepe conditions and goe to <hi>Roſtock;</hi> but into <hi>Havelberg</hi> would they goe, that they would. This had croſt the Kings deſigne, which he was now about for this <hi>Havelberg.</hi> The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Generall <hi>Banier</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of the way they tooke; ſends Captaine <hi>Hall</hi> to meete with them: who falling fowle vpon them; kills a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and takes the reſt priſoners. Thus payd they for breach of Conditions. The King not knowing of the taking of the Towne, was now comming from <hi>Stetin</hi> with a great power to doe it: but is by the newes of it turn'd backe againe.</p>
               <p>The third Action on this ſide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brandenburg</hi> demaunds <hi>Spandaw</hi> againe.</note> was a paſſage betwixt the King, and the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> thus. The King having in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> before, obteined the towne of <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw,</hi> but for one moneth, and that moneth now out; the <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> demaunds his towne againe. The propoſition very much diſpleaſed the King, becauſe it very much croſt him: yet for his promiſe ſake, he delivers it, <hi>Iune</hi> 8. The next day he ſends word into <hi>Berlin</hi> (the town where the <hi>Elector</hi> held his Court) of a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſite</hi> he meant to giue it: and a Proteſtation withall, that if any thing fell out foule vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, the bloud ſhould not be layd to his charge. The ſame day, he ſtreightly beleaguers <hi>Berlin;</hi> bending his Canon directly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Electors</hi> palace. Out ſends the <hi>Elector</hi> to treate; 3 dayes are ſpent about it; &amp; all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:18626:76"/>Thus at laſt when the men could not agree, the women draw downe the King to milder reſolutions. Two Regiments are received into the Towne for that night: &amp; the concluſion is, that vpon <hi>Iune</hi> 12. the Kings Garriſon is againe admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spandau:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spandaw,</hi> rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered vnto the King.</note> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> is to giue 30000. Rixe Dollars a moneth, towards the payment of the Kings foote; the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of <hi>Pomerland</hi> and <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> being at the charges of maintaining moſt of the horſe. Some may imagine, that this was but a colourable deniall in <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> and rather Art then force, in the King. Their reaſon is; becauſe the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> is brother in Law to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> as having married his ſiſter; and therefore not likely to doe him violence: he beſides, being one of thoſe oppreſſed Princes, whom the King came to relieue. So that this they judge to haue beene ſuch a practiſe, as that (as they ſay) before of the Duke of <hi>Pomerlands</hi> was; and that <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſeem'd to be vnwilling, with what he was glad of; that he might haue this anſwere, to giue the Emperour, That he was forced to it. I cannot tell: but this I beleeve, that would <hi>Brandenburg</hi> haue done the King a ſervice, he might haue before done it, by granting <hi>Cuſtrine</hi> vnto him: and that might haue beene the ſaving of <hi>Magdenburg.</hi> This I rather beleeue, that <hi>Magden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> being thus taken and deſtroyed, the Elector was terribly affrighted, and therefore durſt not but deſire <hi>Spandau</hi> againe: but hearing now that <hi>Tilly</hi> was gone a fortnights march from him; engaged otherwhere; and the <hi>Deſſau</hi> bridge broken downe, that he could not returne; he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented vnto the King. Well! the agreement being made, the King on the ſame 12. of <hi>Iune</hi> goes thence by water vnto <hi>Stetin,</hi> there to giue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Ambaſſadour: which he did vpon the 14th after.</p>
               <p>By this time, there having beene ſome murmuring amongſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the King, concerning the taking of <hi>Magdenburg;</hi> as if he had beene too ſlow or defectiue in his aydes or counſells, vnto that Citie: His Majeſtie, though in himſelfe guiltleſſe; yet conſidering that he is cruell to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who is negligent of his owne fame or reputation; he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18626:76"/>
thinkes himſelfe bound in honour to excuſe himſelfe; and therefore ſends abroad this his Apologie, which wee haue here abbreviated.</p>
               <p>That he could never by any perſwaſions or aſſurances draw in the Citizens of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi>

That neither could their owne Prince the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> when in the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1630. he came into their Citie, obtaine ſo much of them: which had it beene done, <hi>Pappenheim</hi> had then beene diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; an inexpugnable Fort might haue beene rayſed; and the Seate of warre haue beene turn'd off from the Citie. That the enemy had ſuch potent <hi>Agents</hi> within the Towne, that all good reſolutions in others, were hindered by them: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their trecheries, is the ruine of their owne Countrey to be imputed. That notwithſtanding all this, the Citie can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his great care in borrowing moneyes from <hi>Hambrough</hi> and <hi>Lubeck</hi> for them; which had beene ſent vnto them. As for any promiſe from his Majeſtie, which the Citizens may alledge that they relyed vpon; they muſt know, that this is to be regulated according to conveniencie, poſſibilitie, and the preſent ſtate of things: ſo that the King might not then endanger the whole action, for the particular of one Citie; eſpecially ſeeing their owne negligence, had now made his promiſe impoſſible to be kept. Moreover, other moſt inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable difficulties haue ſince fallen out and made his relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them impoſſible. As that Imperiall Armie in <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> and <hi>Mecklenburg:</hi> which beſides that it was farre too ſtrong for him in horſe; had even then blockt vp all paſſages from the Eaſt Sea vnto <hi>Magdenburg.</hi> That it had beene in vaine for him to haue attempted any further, vntill he had firſt taken in, thoſe two mightie paſſages of <hi>Gartz</hi> and <hi>Grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen.</hi> That notwithſtanding all his diligence, he could not conveigh any troopes vnto <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> (to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) vntill <hi>November</hi> laſt; by which time, the enemy had

That to ſhew his willingneſſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> he had adventured vpon the taking of <hi>Franckford;</hi> and after that advanced as farre as <hi>Spandaw</hi> and <hi>Potſtayn,</hi> towards it. That notwithſtanding the Towne ſo much concerned the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> yet could his Majeſty never obtaine of him, any aydes towards the reliefe of it; or any paſſage by <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> or the <hi>Deſſau</hi> bridge, towards it. That the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> had not, or could not in time deliver him ſuch victualls and ſhipping, as were neceſſary to it: as having a reſpect vnto what the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> did, or would doe. That he yet knew not, whether theſe two <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors</hi> were or would be, his friends or his enemies. All this conſidered, his Majeſties Councell of warre aſſured him, That with ſo over-wearied an Army, firſt to paſſe ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in the way; and then to haue ſet vpon <hi>Tilly,</hi> had ruind all. Laſtly, that he would haue relieved the Towne, appeares by the neede himſelfe ſtood in of it: ſeeing vpon the newes of the taking of it, he was faine to retyre with his Army; and

project new deſignes for his ſecuritie and proceeding. This was his Majeſties Apologie.</p>
